# HeartDiseasePrediction
It is a prototype of application that predicts if you have a heart disease.
It is based on RandomForest and LogisticRegression models.
The RandomForest model predicts well about 86% of the time and the LogisticRegression model predicts well about 91% of the time, but it returns only binary values.
However, the RandomForest returns probability of you having a Heart Disease, so I used both of them to give user more confidence of the prediction being right.
Data used for learning is from kaggle.com, and it contains over 300000 entries.
